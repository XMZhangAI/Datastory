# Mid term Presentation


## Introduction (1-2 minutes):


Hi guys, we are Stian and Wang and we have selected project 6 - Data Journalism: Tell a data-driven long-form story.

Why it is exciting:
- Data driven story - a bit different from the usual articles.
- Visualization - bring a story to life.
- Integrate science and art together.

What is our message:
- We went for a topic about climate changes and the enviroment, because we feel it is an important story to tell. We can already see big changes in our climate and we hear stories about species disappearing regularly. 
- We wanted to look at Norway specifically because it is close by and we already know some things about the subject, but want to deepen our understanding and knowledge. Norway is also an energy exporting country with good reputation and it would be interesting to look closer at how the power supply is in Norway and how much renewable energy is used.
- A data driven story about the enviroment in Norway. We follow a whales' journey through time and look at the different changes in Norways enviroment.




Brief description of the project and its main goal.
Explain why you chose this project or why it's important.


## Approach (2-3 minutes):

### Methodology: Describe how you collected data, analyzed it, and developed the graph.

Methods used:
- Regular meetings with client to discuss the project.
- Trello - agile scrum workflow (trying to use it) where one iteration is between the meetings with the client. 

Technolgies:
- html, js, css, python
- support libraries: P5.js, pandas.py, flask.py


Technologies Used: Mention the tools, programming languages, libraries, or frameworks you used.


Graph Demonstration (2-3 minutes):

Show how the graph functions, explaining how it displays data over time.
Demonstrate how the slider changes the image on the right side and explain how this helps to convey the story or information you are presenting.
Team Work and Collaboration (1-2 minutes):

### Discuss how the team collaborated.
How did you divide tasks and overcome any collaborative challenges?
Your team: Who is involved and what are their roles?
- Stian: Data collecting
- Wang: Visualization

But we still try to help each other and discuss the project. 

When we started the project we had a problem with the group set up. One member left the group and the course, and we had to try to start the project again. We ended changing the project from 5 to 6, as this was a better fit for us that were left in the group. We used a couple of weeks on this and we started working on the project later.

## Challenges and Solutions (1-2 minutes):

Discuss any challenges you encountered along the way and how you solved them.
If there were any particular insights or learnings obtained from these challenges, share those.

## Conclusion (1 minute):

Summarize what has been achieved so far, and what the next steps in the project will be.
